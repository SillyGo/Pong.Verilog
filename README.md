# Pong.Verilog
In this project, i create the classic game of PONG using only Verilog, the altera DE2-115 board, and a VGA monitor.
Other than this, i also show the process for creating pong out of, well, circuits basically, explaining the basics of VGA, and then entering deeper waters as i explain colours and DAC's (in this case, it's going to be more of a lesson
on the altera DE2-115 board's onboard DAC). Then, i will sort of explain the very basics behind the pong game, such as the process of drawing in a screen (spoiler alert: it's all math), collisions, etc.
Hope you enjoy this project as much as i (sort of) enjoyed making it!
